# GNRTV.BOTS
A section of GNRTV.CELLS featuring a bunch of Algorythmic Sonic Automats
///////
GNRTV.BOTS / Sonic BOTS are a set of experimental modules
that we can build with GNRTV.CELLS* Toolkit, in order to get sonic automats.
In short, it is a set of sonic algorithms which are played automatically. 
This automation is Generative, therefore based on physical models and/or biological models. 
It is worth to remind that although it has some conceptual common concepts with AI, 
generative methods are inspired by other kind of intelligences 
and emergency systems with a non anthropocentric perspective.
